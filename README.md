# interpreters

i track my learnings about crafting interpreters in this repository.
the only reference unless listed somewhere as a comment otherwise, is the book "crafting interpreters" by robert nystorm.


a link to robert's repo that does the same thing as this one: https://github.com/munificent/craftinginterpreters
this is not a fork, because i am writing code while referring to his book.
